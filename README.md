This document contains a 108 page \LaTeX\ file which contains a lot equations
in physics. It is written at advanced undergraduate/postgraduate level. It is
intended to be a short reference for anyone who works with physics and often
needs to look up equations.

If you find any errors or have any comments, please let me know. I am always
open for suggestions and possible corrections to the physics formulary.

The Physics Formulary is made with MiKTeX.

If you prefer the notation in which
vectors are typefaced in boldface, uncomment the redefinition of the
\vec command in the TeX file and recompile the file.
